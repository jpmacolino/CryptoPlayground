DISCLAIMER: This is not meant for anyone to use in actual trading of crypto assets. I might, but you shouldn't, especially not if you're just relying on my work here.

Since I'm currently looking for work in data science, I figured I'd take the opportunity to kill the proverbial two birds with one stone. While I work to generate income trading crypto (a risky and not recommended endeavor), I beieve pulling insights from the data will provide me an advantage. Further, this serves to show how accuractely (or inaccurately as it may end up) I am able to build price prediction models in Python. 

This includes price data extracted from Coinbase. The goal is to use a Jupyter notebook to analyze historical prices for a variety of coins and make models so I can initiate informed trades. I will still be pulling the trigger myself and I trust human intellect over machine models.
